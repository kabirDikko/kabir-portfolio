## Data Mining with Lasers: 3D Point Cloud Object Classification

**Project Overview:**  
This project focused on developing an advanced machine learning system capable of identifying and classifying objects within three-dimensional point cloud data captured by LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors. The challenge required innovative approaches to process massive volumes of spatial data points and transform them into meaningful object classifications. This work has significant applications in autonomous vehicles, robotics, environmental monitoring, and urban planning.

### Technical Details

- **Data Acquisition:** Worked with high-fidelity simulated LIDAR sensor data generating dense point clouds of up to 72,000 data points per individual scan. Each point contained precise X, Y, and Z spatial coordinates with millimeter-level accuracy, creating detailed 3D representations of environmental scenes.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Engineered sophisticated filtering algorithms using statistical outlier removal and voxel grid downsampling with adaptive thresholds. These techniques successfully reduced data volume by 70â€“98% while preserving critical geometric features, dramatically improving processing efficiency without sacrificing classification accuracy.
- **Segmentation:** Implemented optimized Euclidean clustering algorithms leveraging kd-trees (k-dimensional trees) with O(log n) search complexity to partition raw point clouds into distinct object candidates. This approach dynamically adjusted clustering parameters based on point density, enabling effective object isolation even in challenging scenarios with overlapping or partially occluded objects.
- **Feature Extraction:** Developed a comprehensive feature extraction pipeline utilizing the Ensemble of Shape Function (ESF) descriptor, which generates a rich 640-bin global descriptor capturing D2, D3, and A3 shape distributions. These ESF descriptors encode sophisticated geometric relationships invariant to rotation, scaling, and partial visibility, providing exceptional resilience against sensor noise, incomplete data, and varying environmental conditions.
- **Classification:** Architected and trained a Random Forest ensemble classifier with 120 specialized decision trees optimized for the high-dimensional ESF feature space. The model incorporated balanced class weights to address dataset imbalances and employed cross-validation to prevent overfitting. This approach delivered superior classification performance while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained environments.

### Results

- Achieved robust classification performance across a diverse dataset spanning 28 distinct object categories:
  - **High accuracy (92-97%):** For well-defined objects with distinctive geometric features such as vehicles, buildings, and large infrastructure elements
  - **Moderate accuracy (78-85%):** For objects with similar shapes or complex geometries like vegetation and street furniture
  - **Lower accuracy (65-75%):** For smaller objects, partially occluded items, or objects with highly variable appearances, highlighting specific areas for future improvement

### Future Enhancements

- Developing more sophisticated segmentation algorithms incorporating region growing and supervoxel techniques to better handle complex, interconnected scenes
- Implementing deep learning approaches such as PointNet++ and DGCNN (Dynamic Graph CNN) to improve feature extraction from raw point cloud data
- Exploring advanced preprocessing techniques including adaptive filtering and context-aware downsampling to enhance descriptor robustness, particularly for handling partial or occluded data
- Investigating multi-modal fusion approaches combining LIDAR data with RGB imagery for improved classification performance
