# Infrastructure for AI-enablement for a large NGO Project

This document outlines the infrastructure architecture and deployment process for the AI-enablement for a large NGO project, focusing on how the system was designed and deployed to enable AI capabilities.

## Infrastructure Overview

The AI-enablement for a large NGO project is built on Microsoft Azure, leveraging a variety of Azure services to create a scalable, secure, and AI-enabled application. The infrastructure is defined and deployed using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform and automated through Azure DevOps pipelines.

### Core Infrastructure Components

1. **App Services**
   - Multiple App Services for different use cases (UC1, UC2, UC3, UC4)
   - Linux-based web applications running Python
   - Integrated with Azure AD for authentication
   - Connected to private virtual networks for enhanced security

2. **Azure Functions**
   - Serverless compute for background processing and API endpoints
   - Integrated with storage and database services
   - Python runtime environment

3. **Azure Cosmos DB**
   - NoSQL database for storing application data
   - Separate databases and containers for different use cases
   - Configured with appropriate throughput and partition keys

4. **Azure Storage**
   - Blob storage containers for each use case
   - Used for storing documents, files, and other unstructured data

5. **Application Insights**
   - Monitoring and telemetry for all application components
   - Performance tracking and error logging

6. **Virtual Network Integration**
   - Private endpoints for secure service communication
   - Subnet integration for App Services and Functions
   - Network isolation for enhanced security

## AI Integration Architecture

The project leverages Azure OpenAI services for AI capabilities, with the following integration points:

### Azure OpenAI Service Integration

1. **Configuration**
   - OpenAI endpoints and API keys are securely stored and passed to applications
   - API version management for compatibility
   - Secret management for API keys

2. **App Service Integration**
   - Each App Service is configured with the necessary OpenAI connection parameters:
     - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
     - `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
     - `OPENAI_API_VERSION`

3. **Function App Integration**
   - Function Apps are configured with OpenAI connection settings:
     - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
     - `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`

4. **Security Considerations**
   - API keys are stored as secure application settings
   - Virtual network integration provides network-level isolation
   - System-assigned managed identities for secure service-to-service authentication

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

The entire infrastructure is defined using Terraform, with a modular approach:

### Module Structure

- **App Service Plan Module**: Defines the hosting plan for web applications
- **App Service Module**: Configures web applications with AI integration
- **Function App Module**: Sets up serverless functions with AI capabilities
- **Cosmos DB Module**: Configures the NoSQL database
- **Storage Account Module**: Sets up blob storage

### Environment Configuration

The infrastructure supports multiple environments:
- Production (`prod`)
- User Acceptance Testing (`uat`)
- Development (`shared-dev`)
- Demo (`demo`)

Each environment has its own configuration files with appropriate variable values.

## Deployment Process

The infrastructure is deployed using Azure DevOps pipelines with a structured approach:

### CI/CD Pipeline

The `azure-pipeline.yaml` defines a multi-stage deployment process:

1. **Generate TFVars Stage**
   - Creates environment-specific variable files
   - Publishes variables as pipeline artifacts

2. **Terraform Plan Stage**
   - Initializes Terraform with backend configuration
   - Creates an execution plan
   - Publishes the plan as an artifact

3. **Terraform Apply Stage**
   - Applies the approved Terraform plan
   - Requires environment approval for production deployments
   - Uses service principal authentication

4. **Terraform Destroy Stage** (conditional)
   - Provides the ability to tear down infrastructure when needed
   - Requires explicit approval

### Security in the Deployment Process

- Service Principal authentication for Azure resources
- Pipeline variables for sensitive information
- Environment approvals for production deployments
- Secure storage of state files in Azure Storage

## AI Enablement Features

The infrastructure supports several AI capabilities:

1. **Azure OpenAI Integration**
   - Direct connection to Azure OpenAI services
   - API version management for compatibility
   - Secure key management

2. **Data Storage for AI Processing**
   - Cosmos DB containers for storing AI-processed data
   - Blob storage for document analysis and generation

3. **Scalable Compute**
   - App Service Plans sized appropriately for AI workloads
   - Function Apps for asynchronous AI processing

4. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Application Insights integration for tracking AI performance
   - Logging of AI operations for auditing and improvement

## Network Security

The infrastructure implements several security measures:

1. **Virtual Network Integration**
   - App Services and Functions integrated with VNets
   - Private endpoints for database and storage access

2. **Access Controls**
   - Azure AD integration for authentication
   - Security groups for authorization
   - Role-based access control

3. **Data Protection**
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Secure storage of secrets and keys

## Conclusion

The AI-enablement for a large NGO project infrastructure is designed with a focus on security, scalability, and AI enablement. By leveraging Azure's PaaS offerings and implementing Infrastructure as Code practices, the project achieves a robust foundation for AI-powered applications with automated deployment processes.

The modular approach to infrastructure definition allows for easy maintenance and extension, while the multi-environment support enables a proper development lifecycle from development to production.
